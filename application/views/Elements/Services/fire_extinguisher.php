					<p>Portable fire extinguishers provide a first line of defense against fires of limited size. Fire extinguishers should be readily accessible and fully functional for immediate use. Since all fire extinguishers are not created equal, it is vital to have the proper size and agent when needed to minimize damage. Properly maintained fire extinguishers operated by trained personnel save lives and prevent property damage.</p>
					<p>According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and state fire code, fire extinguishers shall be maintained annually and inspected monthly. Our technicians will ensure that you have the right extinguisher for the hazard being protected, and that the quantity of extinguishers and the distance between them meet the required code. We also carry monitored fire extinguishers that electronically check for pressure, the existence of the device, and to confirm there is no obstruction. You will be notified as soon as the extinguisher is removed from service whether intentional or accidental.</p>
					<p>All commercial businesses have fire extinguishers and Narshing Fire has a program designed to meet your requirements. Portable units require annual maintenance and monthly inspection. Many of our customers have us train their employees to perform the monthly quick check and we provide the annual maintenance, recharges, and testing as necessary. Some of our customers want us to take care of the entire program, and we have the personnel and the cost-effective plan to meet your needs. Our preventative maintenance program (PM) can ensure you are compliant and ready for any emergency.</p>
