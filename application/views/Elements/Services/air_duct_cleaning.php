				<p>Commercial and residential HVAC systems collect dust, dirt, mold, chemicals, and other contaminants over time that can be harmful to inhale.</p>
				<p>It is recommended that your systems be inspected regularly and, if necessary, cleaned. Clean duct work has been known to improve production and employee satisfaction as well as reduce energy costs and improved employee health.</p>
				<p>An initial assessment or a certified ventilation inspection of your system by an Narshing Fire employee will give you piece of mind. We will provide you with a detailed report to help you make an informed decision.</p>

		<p>Our team cleans your HVAC system and air ducts to a national standard using state of the art abatement technologies, HEPA vacuums and a negative air machine, along with the introduction of powerful compressed air agitation equipment combined with contact cleaning that will completely remove contaminants such as dust, dirt, suspect mold and other biological hazards that can naturally build up over time.</p>



		<p>During the cleaning process, your HVAC system is placed under continuous negative pressure powered by our advanced HEPA filtrated vacuum. This continuous negative pressure allows very fine particles to be removed from the system as they become airborne, ensuring that these particles are not released into the living or work space when the system is turned on after cleaning. The negative&nbsp;pressure extracts the loosened contaminants into our vacuum while never releasing them into your home.</p>
