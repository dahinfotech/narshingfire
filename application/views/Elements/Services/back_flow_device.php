					<p>As a leader in the fire protection industry, our team at Narshing Fire does our part in protecting the earthâ€™s water supply through the testing, maintenance, and installation of backflow prevention systems. A backflow preventer is a mechanical device that ensures water flow in a single direction. These one-way devices are critical in keeping potable and non-potable water from mixing.</p>
					<p>When it comes to protecting our drinking water, you need backflow preventers strategically installed to offer that protection. Let our team of highly trained technicians install the mechanical device that creates a physical barrier to prevent water from flowing back. You can count on the team at Narshing Fire to install or replace your backflow preventers at your facility.</p>
					<p>A backflow system must be tested and certified annually. The exact requirements for backflow preventers can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. During this test, water is manipulated through the device to make sure that check valves close and that relief valves open. Since backflow preventers are mechanical devices with metal, plastic, and rubber parts that are under constant water pressure, they are susceptible to failure and need replacement or repair. In some cases, full replacement of the device or assembly will be necessary to uphold the integrity of our water supply. Narshing Fire is the company you can count on.</p>
